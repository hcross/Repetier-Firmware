If you are upgrading from an earlier version, make sure you followed the upgrade
instructions for that version.


Upgrade to 0.70

The configurations files Configuration.h and uiconfig.h have undergone larger
modifications. The best is to use the new config files and copy your values into them.
If you don't use the printer user interface you don't need to modify uiconfig.h

The new firmware stores one more parameter into EEPROM. This place is not initalized
with a useful value, so you must explicitly overwrite it if you are using EEPROM. The
easiest way is to send the following code after the first upload:

M206 T3 X0 P196

The advance algorithm changed. Now the new linear term Advance-L is preferred and the
quadratic term is now disabled by default. If you still want to use the quadratic term
add a

#define ENABLE_QUADRATIC_ADVANCE 

to the configuration.
